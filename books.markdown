This is a list of some books I've read and enjoyed.

### The Data Detective by Tim Harford
Harford is a *Financial Times* columnist and BBC Radio presenter. The book provides ten rules on how best to interpret statistics and provides interesting history and case studies along the way.
    
### The Looming Tower by Lawrence Wright
Probably one of the best narrative non-fiction books I've ever read. The book traces the roots of al-Qaeda and the US Government's efforts to stop the group before the events of September 11, 2001.
